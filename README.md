## My Coding Jounery
Since 2013 I have been maintaining my website and portfolio and changing the content and its technologies. With my websites I have powered them by Content Management Systems such as Webs, Weebly, SquareSpace, WordPress, and other CMS’ to then in 2017 I transitioned too hand-coded my own CMS for the websites with HTML, CSS, and PHP OPP (Object-Oriented Programming), as well as, PHP Procedural Programming languages. Then in 2022 I have transitioned to coding in the NextJS language 🎉
